In the event of decommissioning, a systems engineer must ensure disposal/retirement plans are compliant with relevant laws and regulations (for additional information on disposal or retirement, see the <a href=\"/wiki/Product_and_Service_Life_Management\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Product and Service Life Management\">Product and Service Life Management</a> KA).  \n</p><p>Two additional areas are of interest to the systems engineer during system operation require special attention. First, it may be determined that a system is at the end of its life cycle, but the cost of replacing the system with a completely new design is too expensive. In this case, there will be intense engineering activities for service life extension program (SLEP). The SLEP solution will take into account obsolescence issues, diminishing manufacturing sources and material shortages (DMSMS), and changes in ConOps.  Secondly, in the event that a new SoI is designed and produced as a complete replacement for an existing or legacy system, it will be necessary to manage the migration between systems such that stakeholders do not experience a breakdown in services (INCOSE 2012).\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Process_Approaches\">Process Approaches</span></h2>\n<p>During the operational phase, SE activities ensure the system maintains certain operational attributes and usefulness throughout its expected life span. Maintaining operational effectiveness consists of evaluating certain operationally relevant attributes and trends, taking actions to prevent degradation of performance, evolving the system to meet changing mission or business needs (see the <a href=\"/wiki/Product_and_Service_Life_Management\" class=\"mw-redirect\" title=\"Product and Service Life Management\">Product and Service Life Management</a> KA), and eventually decommissioning the system and disposing of its components. During operation, data would be collected to evaluate the system and determine if changes should be made. It is important to include the process for data collection during operations when considering design and ConOps. In some cases, data may be collected by sensors and reported autonomously. In other cases, operators will identify and report on performance during operations. The systems engineer needs to understand how all data will be collected and presented for further analysis. The systems engineer will be involved in analysis of this data in several areas, including the following: \n</p>\n<ul><li>Updating training and development of new training as required for operational and support personnel. Training is generally developed early with system design and production and executed during integration and operations. Determination of training updates or changes will be based on evaluation of the operational and support personnel.</li>\n<li>Evaluation of operational effectiveness. Early in the planning phases of a new system or capability, measures of operational effectiveness are established based on mission and business goals. These measures are important during system operation. These attributes are unique for each system and represent characteristics describing the usefulness of the system as defined and agreed to by system stakeholders. Systems engineers monitor and analyze these measurements and recommend actions.</li>\n<li>Failure reporting and corrective actions (FRACA) activities will involve the collection and analysis of data during operations. FRACA data will provide trends involving failures that may require design or component changes.  Some failures may also result in safety issues requiring operational modifications until the offending elements under analysis can be corrected. If components or systems must be returned to maintenance facilities for corrective repairs, there will be operational and business impacts due to increased unavailability and unplanned transportation cost.</li></ul>\n<h3><span id=\"Applicable_Methods_&amp;_Tools\"></span><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Applicable_Methods_.26_Tools\">Applicable Methods &amp; Tools</span></h3>\n<p>Operations manuals generally provide operators the steps and activities required to run the system.\n</p>\n<h4><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Training_and_Certification\">Training and Certification</span></h4>\n<p>Adequate training must be provided for the operators who are required to operate the system. There are many objectives of training:\n</p>\n<ul><li>Provide initial training for all operators in order to equip them with the skill and knowledge to operate the system. Ideally, this process will begin prior to system transition and will facilitate delivery of the system. It is important to define the certification standards and required training materials up front (for more information on material supply, please see <a href=\"/wiki/Logistics\" class=\"cat-part_3 cat-system_deployment_and_use cat-topic\" title=\"Logistics\">Logistics</a>).</li>\n<li>Provide continuation training to ensure currency of knowledge.</li>\n<li>Monitor the qualification/certification of the operators to ensure that all personnel operating the system meet the minimum skill requirements and that their currency remains valid.</li>\n<li>Monitor and evaluate the job performance to determine the adequacy of the training program.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Practical_Considerations\">Practical Considerations</span></h2>\n<p>The operation process sustains system services by assigning trained personnel to operate the system, as well as by monitoring operator-system performance and monitoring the system performance.

Tasks in the maintenance plan are allocated to the various maintenance agencies. A maintenance allocation chart is developed to tag the maintenance tasks to the appropriate maintenance agencies. These include: in-service or in-house work centers, approved contractors, affiliated maintenance or repair facilities, original equipment manufacturer (OEMs), etc. The maintenance plan also establishes the requirements for the support resources.  \n    </p><p>Related activities such as resource planning, budgeting, performance monitoring, upgrades, longer term supportability, and sustenance also need to be managed. These activities are planned, managed, and executed over a longer time horizon and they concern the well-being of the system over the entire life cycle.  \n    </p><p>Proper maintenance of the system (including maintenance-free system designs) relies very much on the availability of support resources, such as support and test equipment (STE), technical data and documentation, personnel, spares, and facilities.  These have to be factored in during the acquisition agreement process.\n    </p>\n    <h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Training_and_Certification\">Training and Certification</span></h2>\n    <p>Adequate training must be provided for the technical personnel maintaining the system.  While initial training may have been provided during the deployment phase, additional personnel may need to be trained to cope with the increased number of systems being fielded, as well as to cater to staff turnover. Timely updates to training materials and trained personnel may be required as part of system upgrades and evolution.  It is important to define the certification standards and contract for the training materials as part of the supply agreement.\n    </p>\n    <h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Practical_Considerations\">Practical Considerations</span></h2>\n    <p>The organization responsible for maintaining the system should have clear thresholds established to determine whether a change requested by end users, changes to correct latent defects, or changes required to fulfill the evolving mission are within the scope of a maintenance change or require a more formal project to step through the entire systems engineering life-cycle. Evaluation criteria to make such a decision could include cost, schedule, risk, or criticality characteristics.\n    </p>\n    <h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n    <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Works_Cited\">Works Cited</span></h3>\n    <p>ISO/IEC/IEEE. 2015.<i><a href=\"/wiki/ISO/IEC/IEEE_15288\" class=\"cat-primary_reference\" title=\"ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288\">Systems and Software Engineering - System Life Cycle Processes</a>.</i>Geneva, Switzerland: International Organization for Standardization (ISO)/International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). <a href=\"/wiki/ISO/IEC/IEEE_15288\" class=\"cat-primary_reference\" title=\"ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288\">ISO/IEC/IEEE 15288</a>:2015.\n    </p>\n    <h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Primary_References\">Primary References</span></h3>\n    <p>Blanchard, B.S. and W.J.

An acquisition process for major systems in industry and defense is shown in Figure 1. The process of acquisition is defined by a series of phases during which technology is defined and matured into viable concepts. These concepts are subsequently developed and readied for production, after which the systems produced are supported in the field. \n</p><p>Acquisition planning is the process of identifying and describing needs, capabilities, and requirements, as well as determining the best method for meeting those requirements (e.g., program acquisition strategy). This process includes procurement; thus, procurement is directly linked to the acquisition process model. The process model present in Figure 1 allows a given acquisition to enter the process at any of the development phases. \n</p><p>For example, a system using unproven technology would enter at the beginning stages of the process and would proceed through a lengthy period of technology maturation. On the other hand, a system based on mature and proven technologies might enter directly into engineering development or sometimes even production. \n</p>\n<div class=\"center\"><div class=\"thumb tnone\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:452px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:ACQProcessModel_NoWhiteS.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/w/images/sebokwiki-farm!w/thumb/a/ae/ACQProcessModel_NoWhiteS.png/450px-ACQProcessModel_NoWhiteS.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"450\" height=\"251\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/w/images/sebokwiki-farm!w/thumb/a/ae/ACQProcessModel_NoWhiteS.png/675px-ACQProcessModel_NoWhiteS.png 1.5x, /w/images/sebokwiki-farm!w/a/ae/ACQProcessModel_NoWhiteS.png 2x\" data-file-width=\"722\" data-file-height=\"402\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:ACQProcessModel_NoWhiteS.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div><b>Figure 1.

SE is an overarching process that the program team applies in order to transition from a stated capability need to an affordable, operationally effective, and suitable system. \n</p><p>SE is important to every phase of the acquisition process. SE encompasses the application of SE processes across the acquisition life cycle and is intended to be an integrating mechanism for balanced solutions addressing capability needs, design considerations, and constraints. It is also intended to address limitations imposed by technology, budget, and schedule. \n</p><p>SE is an interdisciplinary approach; that is, it is a structured, disciplined, and documented technical effort to simultaneously design and develop system products and processes to satisfy the needs of the customer. Regardless of the scope and type of program, or at what point it enters the program acquisition life cycle, the technical approach to the program needs to be integrated with the <span class=\"noprint\"><a href=\"/wiki/Acquisition_Strategy_(glossary)\" class=\"cat-glossary_of_terms\" title=\"Acquisition Strategy (glossary)\"><span class=\"simple-tooltip simple-tooltip-inline\" data-simple-tooltip=\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;lt;blockquote&amp;gt;A comprehensive, integrated plan that identifies the acquisition approach and describes the business, technical, and support strategies that management will follow to manage program risks and meet program objectives. The acquisition strategy should define the relationship between the acquisition phases and work efforts, and key program events such as decision points, reviews, contract awards, test activities, production lot/delivery quantities, and operational deployment objectives.&lt;/i&gt; (DAU 2010)&amp;lt;/blockquote&amp;gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\">acquisition strategy</span></a></span><span class=\"printonly\">acquisition strategy</span> to obtain the best program solution.\n</p><p>Acquisition and procurement in the commercial sector have many characteristics in common with their counterparts in the realm of government contracting, although the processes in the commercial world are usually accomplished with fewer rigors than occur between government and contractor interactions.  Offshore outsourcing is commonly practiced in the commercial software arena with the goal of reducing the cost of labor. Commercial organizations sometimes subcontract with other commercial organizations to provide missing expertise and to balance the ebb and flow of staffing needs.  \n</p><p>In some cases, relations between the contracting organization and the subcontractor are strained because of the contracting organization\u2019s desire to protect its intellectual property and development practices from potential exposure to the subcontractor.  Commercial organizations often have lists of approved vendors that are used to expedite the procurement of needed equipment, products, and services.  In these situations, commercial organizations have processes to evaluate and approve vendors in ways that are analogous to the qualification of government contractors. Many commercial organizations apply SE principles and procedures even though they may not identify the personnel and job functions as \u201csystems engineers\u201d or \u201csystems engineering.\u201d\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Importance_of_the_Acquisition_Strategy_in_the_Procurement_Process\">Importance of the Acquisition Strategy in the Procurement Process</span></h2>\n<p>The <span class=\"noprint\"><a href=\"/wiki/Acquisition_Strategy_(glossary)\" class=\"cat-glossary_of_terms\" title=\"Acquisition Strategy (glossary)\"><span class=\"simple-tooltip simple-tooltip-inline\" data-simple-tooltip=\"&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href='/wiki/Acquisition_Strategy_(glossary)' class='cat-glossary_of_terms' title='Acquisition Strategy (glossary)'&gt;acquisition strategy &lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\">acquisition strategy</span></a></span><span class=\"printonly\">acquisition strategy</span> is usually developed during the front end of the acquisition life cycle. (For an example of this, see the Technology Development Phase in Figure 1.) The acquisition strategy provides the integrated strategy for all aspects of the acquisition program throughout the program life cycle. \n</p><p>In essence, the acquisition strategy is a high-level business and technical management approach designed to achieve program objectives within specified resource constraints. It acts as the framework for planning, organizing, staffing, controlling, and leading a program, as well as for establishing the appropriate contract mechanisms. It provides a master schedule for research, development, testing, production, fielding, and other SE related activities essential for program success, as well as for formulating functional strategies and plans. \n</p><p>The offeror\u2019s program team, including systems engineering, is responsible for developing and documenting the acquisition strategy, which conveys the program objectives, direction, and means of control based on the integration of strategic, technical, and resource concerns. A primary goal of the acquisition strategy is the development of a plan that will minimize the time and cost of satisfying an identified, validated need while remaining consistent with common sense and sound business practices.  While the contract officer (CO) is responsible for all contracting aspects, including determining which type of contract is most appropriate, and following the requirements of existing regulations, directives, instructions, and policy memos of an organization, the program manager (PM) works with the CO to develop the best contract/procurement strategy and contract types.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Relating_Acquisition_to_Request_for_Proposal_and_Technical_Attributes\">Relating Acquisition to Request for Proposal and Technical Attributes</span></h2>\n<p>There are several formats for requesting proposals from offerors for building complex systems.  Figure 2 relates acquisition program elements to a representative request for proposal (RFP) topical outline and key program technical attributes that have been used by the Department of Defense. In general, programs have a better chance of success when both the offeror and supplier understand the technical nature of the program and the need for the associated SE activities. \n</p><p>The offeror and supplier need to clearly communicate the technical aspect of the program throughout the procurement process. The offeror\u2019s RFP and the associated supplier proposal represent one of the formal communications paths. A partial list of key program technical attributes is presented in Figure 2. \n</p>\n<div class=\"center\"><div class=\"thumb tnone\"><div class=\"thumbinner\" style=\"width:652px;\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:RelatingACQtoRFP_NoWhiteS.png\" class=\"image\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/w/images/sebokwiki-farm!w/thumb/1/12/RelatingACQtoRFP_NoWhiteS.png/650px-RelatingACQtoRFP_NoWhiteS.png\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"650\" height=\"489\" class=\"thumbimage\" srcset=\"/w/images/sebokwiki-farm!w/1/12/RelatingACQtoRFP_NoWhiteS.png 1.5x\" data-file-width=\"721\" data-file-height=\"542\" /></a>  <div class=\"thumbcaption\"><div class=\"magnify\"><a href=\"/wiki/File:RelatingACQtoRFP_NoWhiteS.png\" class=\"internal\" title=\"Enlarge\"></a></div><b>Figure 2.

The SEP documents the systems engineering strategy for a project or program and acts as the blueprint for the conduct, management, and control of the technical aspects of the acquisition program (DoD 2011).  The SEP documents the SE structure and addresses government and contractor boundaries. It summarizes the program\u2019s selected acquisition strategy and identifies and links to program risks. It also describes how the contractor's, and sometimes the subcontractor's and suppliers', technical efforts are to be managed.\n</p><p>Once the technical requirements are understood, a contract may be developed and followed by the solicitation of suppliers. The offeror's PM, chief or lead systems engineer, and CO must work together to translate the program\u2019s acquisition strategy and associated technical approach (usually defined in a SEP) into a cohesive, executable contract(s). \n</p><p>Table 1 shows some key contracting-related tasks with indicators of the roles of the PM and LSE.\n</p>\n<table>\n<caption><b>Table 1.

This ensures that the supplier understands the offeror\u2019s requirements and that the offeror understands the supplier's capabilities and limitations, as well as enhancing the supplier's involvement in the development of a program acquisition strategy. During the pre-solicitation phase, the offeror develops the solicitation and may ask suppliers to provide important insights into the technical challenges, program technical approach, and key business motivations. \n</p><p>For example, potential bidders could be asked for their assessment of a proposed system's performance based on the maturity level of new and existing technologies.\n</p>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Contracts_and_Subcontracts\">Contracts and Subcontracts</span></h2>\n<p>Typical types of contracts include the following:\n</p>\n<ul><li><b>Fixed Price</b>: In a fixed price contract the offeror proposes a single price for all products and services to implement the project. This single price is sometimes referred to as low bid or lump sum. A fixed price contract transfers the project risks to the supplier. When there is a cost overrun, the supplier absorbs it. If the supplier performs better than planned, their profit is higher.  Since all risks are absorbed by the supplier, a fixed price bid may be higher to reflect this.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><b>Cost-reimbursement</b> [Cost plus]: In a cost-reimbursement contract the offeror provides a fixed fee, but also reimburses the contractor for labor, material, overhead, and administration costs. Cost-reimbursement type contracts are used when there is a high level of project risk and uncertainty. With this type of contract, the risks reside primarily with the offeror. The supplier gets reimbursed for all of its costs. Additional costs that arise due to changes or rework are covered by the offeror. This type of contract is often recommended for the system definition of hardware and software development when there is a risk of stakeholder changes to the system.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><b>Subcontracts</b>: A subcontractor performs work for another company as part of a larger project. A subcontractor is hired by a general contractor (also known as a prime or main contractor) to perform a specific set of tasks as part of the overall project. The incentive to hire subcontractors is either to reduce costs or to mitigate project risks. The systems engineering team is involved in establishing the technical contract requirements, technical selection criteria, acceptance requirements, and the technical monitoring and control processes.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><b>Outsource contracts</b>: Outsourced contracts are used to obtain goods or services by contracting with an outside supplier. Outsourcing usually involves contracting a business function, such as software design and code development, to an external provider.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><b>Exclusively Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS)</b>: Exclusively COTS contracts are completely satisfied with commercial solutions that require no modification for use. COTS solutions are used in the environment without modifying the COTS system. They are integrated into an existing user's platform or integrated into an existing operational environment. The systems engineering team is involved in establishing the technical contract requirements, technical acceptance, and technical selection criteria.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><b>Integrated COTS</b>: Integrated COTS contracts use commercially available products and integrate them into existing user platforms or operational environments. In some cases, integrated COTS solutions modify the system's solution. The cost of integrating the commercial COTS product into the operational environment can exceed the cost of the COTS product itself. As a result, the systems engineering team is usually involved in establishing the technical outsourcing contract requirements, technical selection criteria, technical monitoring and control processes, and technical acceptance and integration processes.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><b>COTS Modification</b>: COTS modification requires the most time and cost because of the additional work needed to modify the COTS product and integrate it into the system. Depending on how complex and critical the need is, the systems engineering team is usually involved in establishing the technical outsource contract requirements, technical selection criteria, technical monitoring and control processes, and technical acceptance requirements.</li></ul>\n<ul><li><b>IT services</b>: IT services provide capabilities that can enable an enterprise, application, or Web service solution. IT services can be provided by an outsourced service provider. In many cases, the user interface for these Web services is as simple as a Web browser. Depending on how complex and critical the needs are, the systems engineering team can be involved in establishing the technical outsourcing contract requirements, technical selection criteria, and technical acceptance process.</li></ul>\n<h2><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"References\">References</span></h2>\n<h3><span class=\"mw-headline\" id=\"Works_Cited\">Works Cited</span></h3>\n<p>DAU. 2010. <i><a href=\"/wiki/Defense_Acquisition_Guidebook_(DAG)\" class=\"cat-primary_reference\" title=\"Defense Acquisition Guidebook (DAG)\">Defense Acquisition Guidebook (DAG)</a>.</i> Ft.
